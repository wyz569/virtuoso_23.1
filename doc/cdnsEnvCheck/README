cdnsEnvCheck is a tool to check for system configuration for running Cadence
products in Linux systems. It replaces .preHostEnvCheck when using
--short-check option.

.preHostEnvCheck distributed along with cdnsEnvCheck is a wrapper that calls
cdnsEnvCheck --short-check to perform checks that are independent of releaes.

Checks performed by --short-check option:
    - Checks if the OS and OS version are supported by Cadence
    - Checks if the Linux kernel version is correct
    - Checks if the GlibC version is correct.

GlibC version check can be skipped by setting W3264_SKIP_GLIBC_VER_CHECK to 1.

W3264_NOWARN_UNSUPPORTED_CENTOS can be set to supress warning for CentOS systems.
