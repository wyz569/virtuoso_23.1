This file describes the setup requirements for the System Configuration
Checking Tool. This tool includes two parts:

 - The script that performs the check.
 - A group of data files that define all the parameters/patches
   that need to be checked.

We also have a "doc/check_conf" directory that includes this README file
and a man page that describes how to use the script, checkSysConf.

The datafile directory structure is configured so that each platform type
and each operating system have a directory tree. The actual patch data is
in a Cadence tool release file, such as IC443. The naming convention is
flexible. As long as the directory structure and format are retained, you
can operate this tool for other uses as well (ie Y2K, 3rd party tools, etc).

The system constituents are installed in the following directory structure:

    - tools.hppa
        - bin

Running
=======
To run this script, first download the tarfile into /tmp. Then, cd to
/tmp or <cds_install_dir> and untar the /tmp/checkSysConf_new.tar
file. For example:

cd <cds_install_dir> (or cd /tmp)
tar xfv /tmp/checkSysConf_new.tar
cd tools.<plat>/bin (the <plat> could be sun4v, or hppa, or ibmrs, or lnx86>
./checkSysConf -h
./checkSysConf IC6.1.7

You need to have "root" privilege to run the HP version.  This is not a
requirement for the Linux, SUN and IBM versions.

The output is also saved in the /tmp/checkSysConf.<hostname>-<date>.log
file.
